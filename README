Read your DRO gauge over UART TX!

Project page: https://analog10.com/posts/external_power_for_the_pittsburgh_dial_gauge.html

Build:
1) Build prequisites are an msp430 cross compiler (e.g. mspgcc) and the msp430 headers.
2) Run make to build the DRO_Gauge.elf executable.

Installation and usage:
1) Use mspdebug to install.
2) If no DRO gauge is connected there will be no output.
3) If there are pulses but the count is not valid an error code prefixed with 'E' will be printed, terminated by a newline '\n'.
4) If valid data is read then the LED blinks and a measurement appears on the TX line.
5) The measurement format starts with 'M' and contains 6 alphabetical hexadecimal digits; simply subtract 'A' to get the raw value. The measurement is also '\n' terminated.
